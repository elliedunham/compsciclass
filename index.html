<p>My cause is that the purpose of life is all about you. What I mean by that is that people should live life selfishly. I don't mean that ou should be mean and selfish towards others, but live life doing things that you want. </p>
<p> I know that seems selfish but I'm the only person experiencing my life. Also life is short, so I think you should spend it doing whatever you want, whether it's something that makes you happy or sad.  </p>
