<p>My cause is that the purpose of life is all about you.</p>
<p> What I mean by that is that people should live life selfishly. I don't mean that you should be mean and selfish towards others, but live life doing things that you want. There are many stories out there about people's families controlling/influencing people's decision and they end up being unhappy or miserable. I think to prevent this, you should just do what you want. I acknowledge that there are reasons why this is a bad idea but oh well. I know that seems selfish but I'm the only person experiencing my life. Also life is short, so I think you should spend it doing whatever you want, whether it's something that makes you happy or sad.  </p>
